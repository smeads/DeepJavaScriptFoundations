Notes on Kyle Simpson's course Deep JavaScript Foundations on Frontend Masters

### Scope & Closures

**Scope:** Set of rules for storing variables in some location and for finding those variables at a later time. Where to look for things.
...JavaScript is a compiled language. It's a common misconseption that it's an interpreted language.

...A good question to ask when thinking about scope is, _Who is doing the looking?_
